<h1>Homework 9: Firearm Mortality RateChoropleth </h1>
<h2>Julia Brazer</h2>
<h3>This map is representative of the death rate by firearms in 2019 in each state. The rate is calculated by number of deaths divided by total popultion and multiplied by 100,000. I chose this topic in light of recent gun violence issues. I was curious to see how frequent deaths like this occured and if location by state had any influence.</h3>
