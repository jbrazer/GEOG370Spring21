    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <!-- <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2> -->
    <p>Using QGIS, I created these different projections based on a base map that I uploaded from Natural Earth's data. From there, I picked my base map's color to be orange, my indicatrix as pink, and my grid lines as black. In the bottom right of the program, it indicates what projection is being displayed, and I clicked where it originally said "EPSG..." and then typed in the 'code' for the projection I was searching for. From there I went on to save it andlabel each one. I pushed my HTML page through GITHUB which them ended up becoming this web page!</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map is the current golbal reference system, as it is the most accuracte representation that includes multiple aspects. Area is represented well, the map's origin is at the Earth's center so shape is truer towards the center, but becomes wonkier towards the poles.</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>Meridians are equidistant and angled towards the Prime Meridiam. Shape and area are both slightly off, but everything along the centeral lines look pretty accurate, although there is a slight shape change further out as you can see by the indicatrix.</h3>

    <h2>Pseudo Mercador Projection</h2>
    <h3>Shape and distance are accurate, as this type of map was used for sea travel to reference true North with compass navigation. Size representation is very distorted. In actuallity, Greenland is 1/8 the size of Africa, but the projection makes them the same size. Shape is accurate, as the indicatrix are perfect circles, but differ in size. </h3>

    <h2>Sphere Winkle I Projection</h2>
    <h3>There is a general shape and size distortion that you can see by the irregular indicatrix. The centeral Meridian and all parallels are straight lines, but moving further E. and W. the meridians begin to curve. The total area is to scale, but not at large/local scales, with distorted direction and distance at the poles.</h3>

    <h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area Projection</h2>
    <h3>Uses straight lines for indicating meridians and parallels. with best accuracy along slim areas near the centeral lines. Land area is accurate, with some areas having a .5 m x 2 m comparison. There is distortion in shape near the poles, but it is true along and near the equator.</h3>

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>The meridians are equally spaced, and area distortion gradually increases after the first parallel, but remains constant along each parallel. General scale seems to follow a similar pattern, remaining constant along each parallel and increasing as you move further away from the center.</h3>

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>The meridians are straight lines, while the latidudes/parallels are circular. Only the inner parallel seems to be true to shape and size, and increases with each setep away from the center.</h3>

    <h2>World Equidistant Cylindrical (Sphere) Projection</h2>
    <h3>The projection is made with contact at the equator. As you get further from the equator/line of tangency, area and shape become increasingly distorted.</h3>

    <h2>World Craster Parabolic Projection</h2>
    <h3>Meridian looks to be about half the size of the equator line. Area looks to be about an equal representation, and there is shape distortion away from the center as you move toward the poles.</h3>

    <!-- <h2 style="color:red">Now, you should <u>add the following projections on your own:</u></h2> -->
    <!-- <h3>EPSG:  102016, and two additional projections that you choose.</h3> -->
