Not only has the waterway been filled in in order to support new infrastructure, but directly south of it there has been a new bridge and road-way have been constructed in order to grant passage to the cruise ship ports and terminals. Directly north of the arena has also been filled in for recreational space which now houses two meuseums. Just south of the new bridge, the docks have been built out to accommodate greater volumes of recreation, as well as converted into commercial space, known as Bayside Marketplace, where a Hard Rock Cafe has been established, as well as a number of other bars and resaturants. There is even a ferris wheel which can be taken to overlook the greater Downtown Miami/South Beach area.";

Now, the plot has been built up with one of the most famous hotels in Miami. The hotel's exterior displays an LED silouette performance of dancers who enter in a contest every year. The area north of the hotel, Bay Front Park, was expanded and went from a pretty average green, waterfront space with no more than one significant feature, to a completely built out and popular park which is home to many music events such as Ultra Music Festival, Rolling Loud Music Festival, and the 'Big Orange' New Years Celebration. In expanding the public realm using the park, there is now a band shell pavillion, multiple memorials and towers, a childrens playground, a large fountain, an amphitheater, and multiple bike and walking trails.";

In the area surrounding the club, the most notable additions include the build out of I-95 into Downtown Miami, which has inspired a lot of growth in public recreation space, as well as the above ground metro line that circulates the downtown area for ease of access to the city. The metro rail parallels Biscayne Blvd on 2nd Ave, and has notable stops in places like Meuseum Park, the Adrinne Arsht Center (which houses a concert hall and performing arts center), Historic Overtown, Riverwalk, Brickell, the Financial District, Bayfront Park and so much more. The metro's addition has created an easy mode of public transportation for anyone to explore the city and not have to increase carbon footprint or waste time searching for parking on the busy streets.
